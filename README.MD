# WELCOME TO CHILI PIPER SETTINGS TEMPLATE

This is a basic HTML template that emulates the chili piper settings page.

## Live Demo
You can see a live demo of this project [HERE](https://danortdev.github.io/chili-piper-settings/)

## Usage

Theres no build for the moment, so you just need to open the static
HTML file (index.html) with the browser, Ideally we should have some ES6 transpilation in order to support more browsers, but I don't think we need to add any bundle at the moment.

## Considerations
This was a test, so I didn't had unlimited time.

## Developing
(This is not a growing project, but for documentation sakes)

1. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. If you need to customize any semantic-ui module check the site
overrides or variables for that module. That's the right way to
override the semantic-ui behavior (feel free to create a new theme if
theres a lot to override).
4. Build your changes: go to semantic-ui folder and run `gulp build`
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
6. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
7. Submit a pull request :D (once the PR is merged you can see your changes on https://danortdev.github.io/chili-piper-settings/)
